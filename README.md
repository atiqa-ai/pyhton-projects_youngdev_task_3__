# Hiiii
I am Atiqa and I have started my 1st remote internship at @ youngdev interns and i have learnt many new python topics and have cleared my concepts.Here is brief summary of whatever I learnt during my internship summary 

## Python concepts :

1. Lists,Tuples,Dictinaries,String and sets

2. Functions and types(lambda, recursive)

3. Iterative and conditions

4. Classes and Objects (OOp)

5. OOP pillars (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance)

6. File handling

These concepts helped me building **real world example programs** like:

## Student record management system

## Library management system

## file handling record system
